# distil-wasm
A WebAssembly version of [Elliot Jackson](https://github.com/elliotekj)'s library called [distil](https://github.com/elliotekj/distil)

# Development


To setup a rust environment with WebAssembly superpowers I used this wonderful resource right [here](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-wasm/setup.html).

# Run (Mac/Linux)

```bash
$ sh run.sh
```

This script will compile and power up an HTTP server via Python cli.
